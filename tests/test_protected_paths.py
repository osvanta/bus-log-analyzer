"""Cover the protected-path guard's matching rules.

The guard is the only enforcement point for the PR policy — CODEOWNERS just
requests review, and "Require review from Code Owners" is off because a lone
owner cannot self-approve. So the pattern lists are worth testing directly.

`tools/` is not a package, so the module is loaded from its path.
