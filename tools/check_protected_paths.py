"""
Fail if a change touches files the project owner has declared protected.

The lists below are transcribed from docs/PR_Policy.md. They exist so the rule is
enforced by CI rather than depending on a contributor (human or AI agent)
having read the doc.

Usage:
    python tools/check_protected_paths.py                  # vs origin/main
    python tools/check_protected_paths.py <base> <head>    # explicit revs (CI)

Exit codes:
    0 — no protected file touched
    1 — protected file touched
    2 — could not determine the diff (git failure, bad revs)

Override: the owner applies the `approved-pipeline-change` label to the PR,
which makes the CI guard job skip this check entirely.

#
# build.yml runs with `contents: write` on a `v*.*.*` tag push. A contributor
# cannot push that tag — only the owner can — but a merged PR that edited the
# workflow gets to run its own steps under the owner's next release tag, with
# the release token. Guarding `.github/` closes that merge-then-ride-the-tag
# path.
#
# `tools/` is here for the same reason one step removed: without it, a PR could
# edit this very file to delete entries from the lists above, and the guard
# would pass its own diff. CODEOWNERS covers both paths, but it only *requests*
# review — "Require review from Code Owners" is deliberately off, since a lone
# owner cannot self-approve. So CI is the only enforcement point.
