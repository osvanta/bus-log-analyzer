"""
Lightweight dataclasses shared across the CAN Scope core.

This module has NO heavy dependencies (no cantools, no python-can, no numpy,
no asammdf) so it can be imported at startup without triggering those slow
module-level imports.  All reader/decoder modules import from here instead
of from each other to keep the import graph flat.
